In this project, I will be using stackoverflow public dataset from BigQuery's public dataset. 

1. where are the majority of users located?
2. what are the monthly average active users? i.e out of all the users, how many are active by month in 2019. 
3. where are the active users located? 
4. how many users signup but never post a question or comment? 
5. what are the most common tags? by post/question
