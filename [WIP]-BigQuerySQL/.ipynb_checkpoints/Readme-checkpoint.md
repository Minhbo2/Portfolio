# [WIP] - SQL in BigQuery
In this project, I will be using stackoverflow public dataset from BigQuery's public dataset. 

- What are the total count for gold badges given and overal %?
- Which earned gold badges are the most popular?
- Ranking by tenure(by year joined), how many users earned gold badges based on the year?
- % of active gold badge users in 2020?
