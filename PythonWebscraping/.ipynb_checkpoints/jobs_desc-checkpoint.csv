Stockpile makes buying your first stock easier, taking your next step, or help someone else take theirs. Too many people never even get started investing because of all the unknowns that make the stock market intimidating. But when it comes to investing, starting is everything.

So, Stockpile makes everything easier: easier to get going, easier to get help, and easier to get it right.

We pioneered fractional share investing, stock gift cards, and custodial accounts for kids of any age. These firsts are why we’ve won various “best app” awards from Business Insider, MSN, and Forbes and why we’ve been featured in the Wall Street Journal, CNBC, Consumer Reports, and many others.

Based in Palo Alto, Stockpile is venture-backed, and our extraordinary team comes from diverse industries and backgrounds. All of us are innovators at heart.

You will create user stories, drive completion of all requirements and track delivery status for each capability release.

Primary duties will be to participate in requirements-gathering sessions, understand requirements and data needs and document detailed data attributes, processing needs and features. Work with source teams to obtain scope, schedule, obtain sample data and track deliverables while communicating clearly with the larger organization.

You will regularly present status updates across various organizations along with a hand-off session to CX Data Lake Engineering. You will work closely with the CX Data Lake on delivery execution and process improvements.

Who You'll Work With

We are the CX Digital Transformation team - we support CX. This role will give you great exposure to CX Leadership, processes, data and tools. You will work with CX teams supporting them in managing and delivering their key business objectives on budget.

Who You Are

You are a highly motivated professional who loves understanding CX systems and data and partnering/communicating with the teams you support.

Why Cisco
#WeAreCisco, where each person is unique, but we bring our talents to work as a team and make a difference powering an inclusive future for all.
We embrace digital, and help our customers implement change in their digital businesses. Some may think we’re “old” (36 years strong) and only about hardware, but we’re also a software company. And a security company. We even invented an intuitive network that adapts, predicts, learns and protects. No other company can do what we do – you can’t put us in a box!
But “Digital Transformation” is an empty buzz phrase without a culture that allows for innovation, creativity, and yes, even failure (if you learn from it.)
Day to day, we focus on the give and take. We give our best, give our egos a break, and give of ourselves (because giving back is built into our DNA.) We take accountability, bold steps, and take difference to heart. Because without diversity of thought and a dedication to equality for all, there is no moving forward.
So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us!

2755456478,"At Nuna, our mission is to make high-quality healthcare affordable and accessible for everyone. We are dedicated to tackling one of our nation’s biggest problems with ingenuity, creativity, and a keen moral compass.

Nuna is committed to simple principles: a rigorous understanding of data, modern technology, and most importantly, compassion and care for our fellow human. We want to know what really works, what doesn't—and why.

Nuna partners with healthcare payers, including government agencies and health plans, to turn data into learnings and information into meaning.

YOUR TEAM

Nuna’s products are built to help deliver value-based care, at scale, across the United States healthcare system. Value-based healthcare is a delivery model where providers are paid based on patient health outcomes, instead of traditional fee for service arrangements, driving delivery of higher quality care for patients at lower cost. Today, value-based care is incredibly difficult to operationalize so we’re making it easier with products that enable automated, accurate, and transparent operation of value-based payments.

YOUR IMPACT

Nuna’s Data Solutions team offers an incredible opportunity to work with the world's largest payers (Blues, CMS, States) to capture their methodologies and requirements, build and configure their model logic, and validate the accuracy of our product to ensure that providers feel they are being fairly measured which will be integral in ensuring that patients are properly cared for.

In this role you'll work cross functionally with engineers, product managers and customer liaisons to expand, adapt and configure Nuna’s data products towards the delivery of accurate and scalable value-based payment solutions. You will also help Nuna’s product and engineering teams understand clients’ needs and pain points in order to inform and drive product roadmaps.

YOUR OPPORTUNITIES
Lead, coordinate, and train team members in supporting and building products for healthcare plans and providers.
Identify and understand client’s needs and pain points in operationalizing value based payment arrangements. Translate and distill them into systematic tactical plans to support scoping and prioritization of development work.
Solicit, interpret, and document client business requirements and value based payment methodologies.
Lead and coordinate the effort to verify and validate Nuna’s implementation of client’s value based payment models
Collaborate with Product Managers, Engineering, and Design to identify and design new ways to extend Nuna’s products to better serve customer needs.
YOU BRING
Bachelor’s degree or above in quantitative or engineering fields (Statistics, Economics, Mathematics, Health/Medical Informatics, Computer Science, or similar)
6+ years of experience working with healthcare data paired with a passion to connect with, understand, and shape the healthcare industry.
4+ years of client facing experience in the healthcare industry; Strong oral and written communication skills.
Keen attention to detail and deadline driven.
Proficiency in SQL
BONUSES
Experience with value-driven payment arrangements, healthcare financial models or provider quality measurement strategies.
Experience working at or with health plans or providers.
Experience with Enterprise Software deployment
