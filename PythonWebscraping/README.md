# Python Web Scrapping
Using selenium, this project aims to scrape entry level data analyst jobs in the San Francisco Bay Area region. 

### Scopes:
* Primary site/platform: Linkedin.
* Entry/Junior/Associated levels posting only. 
* Small data set 300 - 500 jobs(ideally, 1000+ is preferred but I am limited by time availability).

### Content:
* __job_post_scraper__: Jupyter notebook for python script. 
* __.CSVs files:__
* * jobs and jobs_desc are raw dataset. 
* * filtered files are cleaned, filtered and are ready for analysis.
