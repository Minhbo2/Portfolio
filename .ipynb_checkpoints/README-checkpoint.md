# Data Analytic Portfolio
This github repo comprises a series of mini projects that cover data analytic topics I am interested in. Some projects are connected and touch on a single topic while others are standalone projects. 

### Scope:
Each project will touch on a single unique topic/task and produce tangible result from it. Data from a separate project can be use in another if needed.  

### Projects:
* __Python Webscraping:__ scraping a small sample set using selenium package for entry level data analyst job posting in the San Francisco Bay area.
* (WIP)__Text Analysis:__  using NLP(NLTK) package for highlighting top tools required by potential employers using data from the Python Webscraping project. 
* (WIP) __Data Visualization:__ exporting dataset from Python Webscraping and Text Analysis projects into Tableau for data visualization dashboard. 
* (WIP) __EDA in Postgres:__ perform EDA on a group of dataset in Postgres using only SQL.    
* (WIP) __Automating Attendance Swap Request:__ using GSuite and Google App Script to create a simple attendance swap approval process.
