# Data Analytic Portfolio
This github repo comprises a series of mini projects that cover data analytic topics I am interested in. Some projects are connected and touch on a single topic while others are standalone projects. 

### Scope:
Each project will touch on a single unique task and produce tangible results from it. Data from a separate project can be use in another if needed.  

### Projects:
* __Python Webscraping:__ scraping a small sample set using selenium package for entry level data analyst job posting in the San Francisco Bay area.
* __Text Analysis:__  using NLP(NLTK) package for collecting data of top tools required by potential employers using dataset from the Python Webscraping project. 
* (WIP) __Data Visualization:__ . 
* (WIP) __SQL in BigQuery:__ perform a quick EDA using Stackoverflow public dataset in BigQuery.    
* (WIP) __API + GAS:__
