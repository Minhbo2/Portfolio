# Data Analytic Portfolio
This github repo contains a series of mini projects that cover data analytic topics I am interested in. Some projects are connected and touch on a single topic while others are standalone projects. 

### Scope:
* Each project will touch on a single unique task. 
* Data from one project can be use in another as supporting materials for a unique topic. 

### Projects:
* __Python Webscraping:__ scraping a small sample set using Selenium package for entry level data analyst job posting in the San Francisco Bay Area.
* __Text Analysis:__  using NLP(NLTK) package for collecting data of top tools required by potential employers using dataset from the Python Webscraping project.  
* __SQL in BigQuery:__ using SQL and python to perform quick exploratory analysis using Stackoverflow public dataset in BigQuery.    
* (WIP) __Data Visualization:__ .
* (WIP) __API + GAS:__
