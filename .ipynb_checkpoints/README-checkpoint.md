# Data Analytic Portfolio
This github repo comprises a series of mini projects that cover data analytic topics I am interested in. Some projects are connected and touch on a single topic while others are standalone projects. 
### Projects:
* __Python Webscraping:__ scraping using selenium package for entry level data analyst job posting.
* (WIP)__Texxt Analysis:__  using NLP(NLTK) package for highlighting top tools skill set required by potential employers using data from the Python Webscraping project.
